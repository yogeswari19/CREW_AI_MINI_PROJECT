This project is to learn the basics of crew AI and how to build an agentic AI application.
I have used this to build an agentic AI system for blog writing. 
There are three agents - reasearch agent, writer agent and SEO agent.

The research agent collects interesting facts about the given topic, the writer agent develops content on the given topic and finally the SEO agent optimizes the article based on SEO like providing apt meta title and description.

FastAPI is used for the backend.
HTML, CSS and Javascript are used for the frontend.

To run the project:
use the command: uvicorn backend:app --reload

Enter the topic in the UI and the blog will be generated.
